User Stories

I will have to display 3 random objects at one time.

I will give the user a chance to vote on an item they would be most likely to buy through a click event.

I will repeat this event 25 times.

I will track the number of votes a particular item recieves.

I will not display the same item in 2 consecutive iterations.

Have a visual display of the data available including the number of times it was clicked and the percentage of times 
it was clicked compared to as many times as it was displayed.  This will be tabulated for the marketing team.
